# Welcome to My GitHub Universe!  
## I’m YuvaRaj AF – UI/UX Designer by Day, Code Alchemist by Night  

---

### About Me  
I’m a passionate **UI/UX Designer** who believes that good design isn’t just eye candy—it’s a perfectly brewed potion of form and function. As a **Code Alchemist**, I wield the magic of Python, C, C++, HTML, and Java to turn ideas into reality. I’m also a **Digital Storyteller**, weaving narratives through pixels and code. When I’m not crafting interfaces or debugging, you’ll catch me gaming or diving into the latest tech trends.  

**Fun Fact:** UX designers are so obsessed with user experience that we’d redesign a ladder just to make climbing it feel like a VIP experience. Every rung, optimized!  
**Quote:** *"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."* – Steve Jobs
